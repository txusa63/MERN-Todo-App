# MERN-Todo-App
This is a JavaScript todo app written in React in the front and Express in the back. 
This app is able to perform CRUD operations on data which can be stored in a MongoDB Atlas cloud database. The user can mark items as complete by clicking the check box. This will cross the item off the list. Clicking the checkbox again will undo the operation. 
If the user wishes, he/she can edit or delete the item from the list.
